# lemoncode-master-module-4-vue

This is a simple application made with Vue 3 in which we use the github api to render the list of members of an organization. We also include a way to filter the list by organization name and let the user navigate to the member detail page. This is an exercise from the [Lemoncode Front End Master](https://lemoncode.net/master-frontend).
