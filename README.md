# lemoncode-master-module-4-vue

A simple application made with **Vue 3** and **Vuex** in which we use the github api to render the list of members of an organization. We also include a way to filter the list by organization name and let the user navigate to the member detail page. We have also used some components from [Element Plus](https://element-plus.org/en-US/) library. 

This is an exercise from the [Lemoncode Front End Master](https://lemoncode.net/master-frontend).
